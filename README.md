There is a data structure for resolving the conflict when there are 2 people concurrently edit the content of the Note. But for simplicity, I don't use it in my Note Taking App - This data structure is Conflict-free Replicated Data Types.

There is also a library that help integrate this data structure for real-time collaborate app - YJS https://github.com/yjs/yjs.
